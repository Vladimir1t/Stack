**Stack: A C Program for Implementing a Stack Data Structure**

**Introduction:**

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This program provides a comprehensive implementation of a stack in C, including functions for creating, pushing, popping, and destroying the stack, as well as reallocation functions to handle dynamic memory management.

**Data Structure:**

The stack is implemented using an array of elements, where the top of the stack is the last element in the array. The following code defines the stack structure:

```c
struct Stack {
    size_t size;
    size_t capacity;
    elem_t* data;
};
```

where:

* `size` represents the number of elements currently in the stack.
* `capacity` represents the maximum number of elements the stack can hold.
* `data` is a pointer to an array of elements.

**Functions:**

The program includes the following functions for manipulating the stack:

* `StackCtor`: Constructor function to create a new stack with the specified capacity.
* `StackPush`: Pushes an element onto the top of the stack.
* `StackPop`: Pops the top element from the stack.
* `StackDtor`: Destructor function to destroy the stack and free its allocated memory.
* `StackReallocIncrease`: Reallocates the stack's array to increase its capacity.
* `StackReallocDecrease`: Reallocates the stack's array to decrease its capacity.
* `Dump`: Dumps the contents of the stack to a specified file.
* `Verifier`: Verifies the integrity of the stack.

**Example Usage:**

The following code demonstrates how to use the stack functions:

```c
#include "Stack.h"

int main() {
    struct Stack stack;

    // Create a stack with a capacity of 10 elements
    StackCtor(&stack, 10);

    // Push elements onto the stack
    StackPush(&stack, &value1);
    StackPush(&stack, &value2);
    StackPush(&stack, &value3);

    // Pop an element from the stack
    elem_t popped_value;
    StackPop(&stack, &popped_value);

    // Dump the stack to a file
    Dump(&stack, stdout);

    // Destroy the stack
    StackDtor(&stack);

    return 0;
}
```

**Error Handling:**

The program uses a separate file named `errorF.txt` to log any errors encountered during the execution of the stack functions. This allows for easy debugging and troubleshooting.

**Conclusion:**

This program provides a robust implementation of a stack data structure in C, making it a valuable resource for programmers working with stacks and other linear data structures. The program's modular design and comprehensive error handling make it easy to use and maintain.
